### Usage

Nice to read: https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/Migrating-from-Vim

TLDR: Operations and moves are reversed in Helix.
First select whatever text you want to operate on, and then use a modifying operation.
That makes things more consistent (Vim needs a separate x and d operation because of the operator -> move order, Helix only needs the d operation).
e.g.

delete a word:
* vim: `dw`
* helix: `wd`

copy a line:
* vim: `yy`
* helix: `xy`

Select a word:
* vim: `*`
* helix: `w‚Üêb*`
